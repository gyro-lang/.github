```

A multi-language, statically typed, syntax extensible programming language built for speed and customizability.

Gyro was developed with the intent to break the boundaries between common programming languages in use today. It supports almost every other language via an extensible plugin system and allows for compile-time compiler modifications for absolute control.

If any of the things we just said spoke to you, you're in the right place!

If you're interested in contributing to Gyro, we'd love to hear from you! We're always looking for talented developers who want to help us make Gyro even better.

To contribute, head over to [our official GitHub repository](https://github.com/gyro-lang/gyro). There, you can browse our issues, submit pull requests, and get involved with the Gyro community.

We also built our own package manager called [Stack](https://github.com/gyro-lang/stack), in our [documentation](https://github.com/gyro-lang/docs) we have a series of guides that will teach you anything and everything from starting to program to writing your own compilers!

And yes, everything here is MIT baby! ðŸ˜‰
Feel free to look around and explore, clone some stuff and get going, we're counting on you!
